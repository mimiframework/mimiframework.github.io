## Mimi: An Integrated Assessment Modeling Framework
 
Mimi is a [Julia](http://julialang.org) package for [integrated assessment models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_assessment_modelling) developed in connection with Resources for the Future's [Social Cost of Carbon Initiative](https://www.rff.org/topics/scc/). 

The source code for this package is located on Github [here](https://github.com/mimiframework/Mimi.jl), and for detailed information on the installation and use of this package, as well as several tutorials, please see the [Documentation](https://www.mimiframework.org/Mimi.jl/stable/). For specific requests for new functionality, or bug reports, please add an [Issue](https://github.com/mimiframework/Mimi.jl/issues) to the repository.

Support for users is primarily hosted on the [Mimi Framework forum](https://forum.mimiframework.org), where we also post PSA topics with recent software updates and important information for users. Please get in touch with [David Anthoff](http://www.david-anthoff.com) if you have further questions about using this framework or want to be involved in any way with this effort.

**To get started with Mimi, head to the documentation [here](https://www.mimiframework.org/Mimi.jl/stable/)!**
