Hello Mimi users! 

Today we officially tagged and released Mimi v1.0.0, which has some new features, documentation, and quite a bit of internals work as well.  Since this is a major version change, there are some breaking changes that may require you to update your code.  We have done the updates for the existing models in the Mimi registry (FUND, DICE, etc.), and will release new major versions of those today as well, so if you are using the latest version of Mimi and the latest version of the packages, all should run smoothly.

**Please view the how to guide here: https://www.mimiframework.org/Mimi.jl/stable/howto/howto_6/ for a run-down of how you should update your own code.**

In addition please do not hesitate to ask any questions on the forum, we are working hard to keep this transition smooth.

The Mimi developement team recently participated in the 2019 Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (AERE) summer conference during the pre-conference workshop on Advances in Integrated Assessment Models. This included both a presentation and a hands-on session demonstrating various use cases for Mimi. The Github repository [here](https://github.com/davidanthoff/teaching-2019-aere-workshop) contains a) all slides from the workshop and b) all the code from the hands on sessions, which may be of interest to Mimi users. Importantly note that the linked code represents as a snapshot of Mimi at the time of the workshop, and **will not** be updated to reflect new changes.
