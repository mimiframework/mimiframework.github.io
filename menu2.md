# Model Registry

For convenience, several models are registered in the [MimiRegistry](https://github.com/mimiframework/MimiRegistry), and operate as packages with the Julia package manager [Pkg](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/index.html). For details on connecting to this central Mimi registry, see the Mimi [Documentation](https://www.mimiframework.org/Mimi.jl/stable/).

Update (5/3/2020): Please note that going forward we are moving away from this model and encouraging registration in the [General Registry](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/registries/) to keep things simple and seamless for users instead of requiring extra maintenance and communication by our team. This will not be a breaking change, so current models registered with the Mimi registry will work as expected.

The models currently included in the registry include those linked below.
